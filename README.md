## Predicting House Prices Using the Boston Housing Dataset:
# Summary of the Notebook:
# Markdown Cells Overview:
# Introduction to Models:
Linear Regression implementation without using built-in libraries.
Random Forest and XGBoost implementations are also crafted manually.
# Evaluation:
The models are compared using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared.
Conclusion:
All models performed similarly for the provided dataset.
# First Code Cell:
# The notebook starts with importing key libraries:
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

### Text Sentiment Analysis
# Introduction:
 Building a sentiment analysis model using the IMDB Reviews dataset.
## Evaluation:
#Text Preprocessing:
Tokenizing text into individual words.
Removing stopwords.
Performing lemmatization for text normalization.
# Feature Engineering:
Converting text data into a numerical format using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
# Model Training:
Training a classifier such as a Logistic Regression classifier to predict sentiment
# Model Evaluation:
Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Outcome:
A Python script capable of detecting fraudulent transactions with evaluation metrics and a testing interface.
## We use the following key libraries:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense,Embedding,LSTM
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
### Fraud Detection System:
# Introduction:
 Developing a fraud detection system using a dataset like the Credit Card Fraud Dataset.
# Evaluation:
# Data Preprocessing:
Handling imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.
# Model Training:
Training a Random Forest to detect fraudulent transactions.
# Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the system's precision, recall, and F1 score.
# Testing Interface:
Create a simple interface (e.g., a command-line input) to test the fraud detection system.
## Conclusion:
A Python script capable of detecting fraudulent transactions with evaluation metrics and a testing interface.
## We use the following key libraries:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score,f1_score,precision_score,recall_score
